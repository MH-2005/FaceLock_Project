A desktop security application for Windows that automatically locks your computer and hardware ports when you step away, built as a high-intensity bootcamp project.

## A Bootcamp Challenge

This project is the proud result of an intensive challenge from the **Kariz AI Bootcamp**. A dedicated team of 10 developers collaborated to design, build, and deliver this entire application in **less than 24 hours**.
